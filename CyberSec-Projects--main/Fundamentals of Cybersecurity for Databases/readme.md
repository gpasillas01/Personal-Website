   - Examples of recent data breaches and their impact on organizations.

2. **Data Sensitivity and Regulatory Compliance**
   - Explanation of data sensitivity and its influence on database security measures.
   - Discussion of relevant regulatory frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and their requirements for database security.

**Fundamentals of Database Security**

3. **Access Control and Authentication**
   - Definition of access control and authentication in database security.
   - Explanation of role-based access control and least privilege principle.
   - Examples and significance of multi-factor authentication.

4. **Encryption and Data Masking**
   - Role of encryption in protecting data at rest and in transit.
   - Explanation of data masking and its relevance in preventing unauthorized access.
   - Comparison between encryption and data masking.

**Security Measures and Best Practices**

5. **Patch Management and Vulnerability Assessment**
   - Definition of patch management and its role in database security.
   - Importance of regular vulnerability assessments.
