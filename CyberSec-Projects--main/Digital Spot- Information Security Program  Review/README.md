# Digital Spot Information Security Program Review

## Project Overview
The goal behind this project was to conduct a thorough Information Security Program Review on our company, Digital Spot, focusing on the implementation of AI technology into our organization’s enterprise infrastructure, while also applying the principles of secure software development. 
## Project Scenario
To allow our company to compete with larger competitors, we were directed to incorporate ChatGPT into Digital Spot’s technology platform. This allowed my team and I to address security implications along with exploring the associated benefits by piloting AI in these functional areas:
- Customer Support
- Marketing
  
## Project Requirements
Based off the Security Program Lifecycle, our team is tasked with:
- **Functional Areas Selection**: Choosing Customer Support and Marketing for ChatGPT pilot.
- **Security Views**: Creating Social, Information, and Authorization views using STS-ml modeling language for both Customer Support and Marketing.
- **Security Design Patterns**: Suggesting security design patterns that will elevate the IT system design.
- **Threat Models**: Developing one threat model per functional area using the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool to anticipate potential attacks.
- **Security Test Cases**: Selecting and supporting two test cases from the OWASP security testing guide. 
- **Security Program Metrics**: Establishing metrics to evaluate security success with a plan for measurement.
- **Senior Leadership Presentation**: Delivering a formal presentation to senior leadership, detailing the end-to-end security program implementation.

## Deliverables
- **Functional Areas**: Customer Support and Marketing selected for the pilot.
- **Security Views**: STS-ml models created for Customer Support and Marketing.
- **Design Patterns**: Authentication, session management, accreditation and ambassador patterns recommended for system design.
- **Threat Models**: Generated threat models using Microsoft Threat Modeling tool for each of the areas. 
- **Test Cases**: Chose and explained thetest cases best suitable from OWASP for Digital Spot’s infrastructure: injection, password policies, and enumerating infrastructure security. 
- **Metrics**: Password and access metrics defined with measurement plans.
- **Senior Leadership Presentation**: Group presentation covering the security program implementation.
