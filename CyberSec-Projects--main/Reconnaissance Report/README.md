## Executive Summary
This repository contains a reconnaissance report conducted on the Certified Hacker website (http://certifiedhacker.com/). The report aims to identify potential vulnerabilities using both passive and active reconnaissance techniques. The findings highlight critical information that could be exploited by malicious actors, emphasizing the importance of proactive security measures.

## Reconnaissance Findings

### Passive Reconnaissance
1. **BuildWith**
   - Detailed analysis of technologies and providers used by the website.
   - Potential vulnerabilities include exposed server details and software versions.

2. **Wappalyzer**
   - Cross-referencing of BuildWith findings, revealing OS versions and security protocols.
   - Identifies potential weaknesses that could be exploited for cyber-criminal activities.

3. **Censys**
   - Provides real-time server location, operating system, and open TCP protocols.
   - Exposes sensitive information that could serve as entry points for attacks.

### Active Reconnaissance
4. **NSLOOKUP**
   - Reveals organizational communication systems and related records.
   - Potential gateway for unauthorized access if exploited.

5. **DigLookups / DNSBrutalattack / DNSEnumeration**
   - Discovers IPV4 addresses, subdomains, and mail exchange servers.
   - Attempts brute-force attacks to gather information, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.

## Summary
The reconnaissance findings indicate significant vulnerabilities within the Certified Hacker website's infrastructure and security protocols. While certain measures like protection against brute-force attacks are in place, critical information such as IP addresses and server configurations remain accessible. Addressing these vulnerabilities promptly is crucial to mitigate potential cyber-attacks and protect sensitive data.
