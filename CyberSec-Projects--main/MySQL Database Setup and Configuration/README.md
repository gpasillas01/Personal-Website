# MySQL Database Setup and Configuration

 ## Introduction
 The MySQL Database Setup and Configuration document shows my successful attempt at setting up a MySQL database management system, using a sample database, and performing various tasks related to database management and security.

 ## Task Overview

 ### Task 1: Installation and Setup
 - **Download and Review Documentation**: Download and review the "world-setup-en.pdf" document (link available in the "How to" section below).
 - **Install MySQL Server**: Follow the instructions in the document to install MySQL Server on your system.
 - **Create MySQL User**: Create a new MySQL user with appropriate privileges for managing the database.
 - **Documentation**: Document the installation and setup process, including screenshots where necessary.

 ### Task 2: Database Creation and Population
 - **Create Database**: Create the "world" database.
 - **Populate Database**: Populate the "world" database with sample data provided in the document.
 - **Verification**: Verify that the database has been created and populated correctly.
 - **SQL Queries**: Include SQL queries used for database creation and population in your documentation.

 ### Task 3: Querying the Database
 - **Write SQL Queries**: Write SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the "world" database.
   - List of all countries.
   - List of cities in a specific country.
   - Population of a specific city.
 - **Documentation**: Document the SQL queries used and provide screenshots of query results.
 - **Challenges and Solutions**: Discuss any challenges faced while querying the database and how you addressed them.

 ### Task 4: Backup and Restore
 - **Backup Database**: Perform a backup of the "world" database using MySQL tools.
 - **Simulate Scenario**: Simulate a scenario where the database is corrupted or lost.
 - **Restore Database**: Restore the "world" database from the backup.
 - **Documentation**: Describe the backup and restore process in your documentation.

 ### Task 5: Security and Access Control
 - **Implement Password Policies**: Implement password policies for MySQL users.
 - **Access Restriction**: Restrict access to the "world" database to specific users.
 - **Documentation**: Document the security measures applied and explain their significance.

## Skills Utilized
- **MySQL Database Management and Administration:** Proficiently managed MySQL databases, including installation, user management, SQL querying, and administrative tasks such as backups and restores.
- **SQL Querying and Optimization:** Effectively wrote SQL queries to retrieve data, populate tables, and verify database status, ensuring efficient database operations.
- **Database Backup and Restore:** Executed backup operations using `mysqldump` and restored databases from backups as part of disaster recovery planning.
- **Database Security and Access Control:** Implemented password policies and restricted database access to specific users, enhancing data security and confidentiality.
- **Documentation and Reporting:** Produced comprehensive documentation with screenshots, detailing installation steps, SQL queries used, backup procedures, and security configurations for clarity and replicability.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL Server:** Installed and configured MySQL Server for database creation, management, and querying.
- **MySQL Workbench:** Utilized for SQL development, database administration, and performance monitoring.
  
## Techniques Used
- **Database Installation and Setup:** Followed documented procedures to install MySQL Server, configure user accounts, and establish database connectivity.
- **Database Creation and Population:** Created the "world" database and populated it with sample data using SQL commands (`CREATE DATABASE`, `INSERT INTO`).
- **SQL Query Writing and Execution:** Wrote SQL queries to retrieve specific data from the database (`SELECT` statements), optimized queries, and verified data integrity (`SHOW` commands).
- **Backup and Restore Operations:** Performed database backups (`mysqldump`) and restored databases from backups to simulate and recover from data loss scenarios.
- **Database Security Implementation:** Implemented password expiration policies and restricted database access (`GRANT` statements) to enforce security measures.
- **Documentation and Reporting:** Prepared detailed documentation with step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and explanations of each task performed, ensuring comprehensive project documentation.
