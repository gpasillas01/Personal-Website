                <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                <p>An extensive vulnerability assessment was performed on the ACME Virtual Box environment hosted on Ubuntu. The assessment aimed to uncover potential threats that could compromise user data and system integrity. The findings highlighted several critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention to mitigate risks effectively.</p>

                <h3>Findings Sorted by Risk</h3>
                <p>The findings were categorized based on the severity of each vulnerability identified during the assessment. Different phases of ethical hacking methodologies were employed, including reconnaissance, scanning and enumeration, vulnerability assessment, and exploitation.</p>

                <h4>Reconnaissance</h4>
                <p>During this phase, various tools such as Nmap were used to gather information about the ACME Virtual Box environment, including IP addresses and network configurations.</p>

                <h4>Scanning and Enumeration</h4>
                <p>Tools like Nmap were employed to scan for open ports and services running on the ACME Virtual Box, revealing potential entry points for attackers.</p>

                <h4>Vulnerability Assessment</h4>
                <p>The assessment identified specific vulnerabilities such as open network ports, outdated software versions, and potential misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches.</p>

                <h4>Exploitation</h4>
                <p>Attempts were made to exploit identified vulnerabilities using tools like Metasploit, aimed at gaining unauthorized access to the ACME Virtual Box environment.</p>

                <h4>Remediation</h4>
                <p>Recommendations were provided to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, including applying security patches, updating software versions, and implementing strict access control measures.</p>

                <h3>Technical Summary</h3>
                <p>The technical summary summarizes the approach taken during the assessment, emphasizing the use of black box testing methodologies to simulate real-world attack scenarios.</p>
